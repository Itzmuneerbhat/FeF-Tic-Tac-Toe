Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or X's and O's, is a simple two-player game that is often used as a beginner's introduction to game strategy and logic. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes turns marking one of the empty cells with their respective symbol—either an "X" or an "O."
# key features 
Tic Tac Toe is often used as a tool to teach concepts of logic, strategy, and problem-solving.
It helps develop critical thinking, as players must anticipate their opponent's moves and plan their own.
# what i learn in this project 
1. Game Structure and LayoutDesigning a simple, functional 3x3 grid using HTML and CSS, ensuring that each cell of the grid is clickable and visually clear.Understanding how to organize the elements of the page (game board, status messages, buttons) in a user-friendly layout.
   2. Handling User InteractionLearning how to capture and respond to user input using JavaScript. Each time a player clicks a cell, their move is registered, and the game logic responds accordingly.Creating a smooth experience where only empty cells can be clicked, and players alternate turns without breaking the flow.
      3. Implementing Game LogicDeveloping core game logic for detecting winning conditions (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).Implementing a way to check for a draw (when all cells are filled and no winner is found).Understanding how to reset the game board, so that players can restart the game without refreshing the page.
         4. Turn-Based Game MechanicsManaging turns between two players, alternating between "X" and "O" after each move, while displaying the current player’s turn to keep the players informed.Preventing further actions when the game ends, either due to a win or draw.
            5. Game State ManagementUsing an array to keep track of the game state (which cells are occupied and by which player).Learning how to manipulate and update this state in real-time based on player actions, and how to clear the state when starting a new game.
