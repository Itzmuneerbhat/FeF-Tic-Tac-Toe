# FeF-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or X's and O's, is a simple two-player game that is often used as a beginner's introduction to game strategy and logic. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes turns marking one of the empty cells with their respective symbolâ€”either an "X" or an "O."
